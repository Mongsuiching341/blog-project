      "body": "Unless you’ve been completely off the grid lately, you’ve heard about or met ChatGPT, the popular chatbot that first went online in November 2022 and was updated in March. Type in a question, comment, or command, as I’ve done, and it quickly produces a human-seeming response in good English for any topic. The system comes from artificial-intelligence research on a language model called a Generative Pre-trained Transformer. From a big database—hundreds of gigabytes of text taken from webpages and other sources through September 2021—it selects the words that are most likely to follow those you’ve entered and forms them into responsive, intelligible, and grammatical sentences and paragraphs.As a scientist and science writer, I especially want to know how ChatGPT deals with science and, equally important, pseudoscience. My approach has been to determine how well each version of the chatbot deals with both well-established and pseudoscientific ideas in physics and math, areas of science where the correct answers are known and accepted. Then I checked how well the latest release deals with the science of COVID-19, where for various reasons there are differing views.Can GPT-4 distinguish correct from incorrect science? For openers, the November version (known as GPT-3.5) knew that 2 + 2 = 4. When I typed “Well, I think 2 + 2 = 5,” GPT-3 defended “2 + 2 = 4” by noting that the equation follows the agreed-upon rules of manipulating natural numbers. It added this uplifting comment: “While people are free to have their own opinions and beliefs, it is important to acknowledge and respect established facts and scientific evidence.” Things got rockier with further testing, however. GPT-3.5 wrote the correct algebraic formula to solve a quadratic equation, but could not consistently get the right numerical answers to specific equations. It also could not always correctly answer simple word problems such as one that Wall Street Journal columnist Josh Zumbrun gave it: “If a banana weighs 0.5 lbs and I have 7 lbs of bananas and 9 oranges, how many pieces of fruit do I have?” (The answer is below.)In physics, GPT-3.5 showed broad but flawed knowledge. It produced a good teaching syllabus for the subject, from its foundations through quantum mechanics and relativity. At a higher level, when asked about a great unsolved problem in physics—the difficulty of merging general relativity and quantum mechanics into one grand theory—it gave a meaningful answer about fundamental differences between the two theories. However, when I typed “E =mc^2,” problems appeared. GPT-3.5 properly identified the equation, but wrongly claimed that it implies that a large mass can be changed into a small amount of energy. Only when I re-entered “E =mc^2” did GPT-3.5 correctly state that a small mass can produce a large amount of energy.Does the newer version, GPT-4, overcome the deficiencies of GPT-3.5? To find an answer, I used GPT-4’s two versions: one accessed through the system’s inventor, OpenAI, the other through Microsoft’s Bing search engine. Microsoft has invested billions in OpenAI and, in February, introduced a test version of Bing integrated with GPT-4 to directly access the internet. (Not to be outdone in a race to pioneer the use of chatbots in internet searches, Google has just released its own version, Bard).To begin, typing “2 + 2 = ?” into GPT-4 again yielded “2 + 2 = 4.” When I claimed that 2 + 2 = 5, GPT-4 reconfirmed that 2 + 2 = 4, but, unlike GPT-3.5, added that if I knew of a number system where 2 + 2 = 5, I could comment about that for further discussion. When asked, “How do I solve a quadratic equation?” GPT-4 demonstrated three methods and calculated the correct numerical answers for different quadratic equations. For the bananas-and-oranges problem, it gave the correct answer of 23; it solved more complex word problems, too. Also, even if I entered E = mc^2 several times, GPT-4 always stated that a small mass would yield a large energy."
